Introduction:

This  car data set taken from Kaggle.To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10,000 rows and more than 10 columns 
which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine Size, HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more. 

--To know more about the data and finding useful information about the data we do perform some python tools on the data.

#IMPORTING ALL NECCESSRY LIBRARIES.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns #visualisation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualisation
%matplotlib inline 
sns.set(color_codes=True)


# IMPORT THE DATA INTO DATA FRAME
Loading the data into the pandas data frame is certainly one of the most important steps in EDA, as we can see that the value from the data set is comma-separated. 
So all we have to do is to just read the CSV into a data frame and pandas data frame does the job for us.

data=pd.read_csv("E:\\CDAC\\data\\data.csv")                    #To import file

data.head(5)                                                   # To display first 5 rows
